Specs Capstone: Menu Master

Menu Master is a web application designed to simplify and enhance menu planning in households. It offers a range of features that streamline the process of creating weekly menus, managing recipes, and generating grocery lists. 

Features: 

- On Hand Ingredients

    Menu Master allows users to maintain a personalized list of on-hand ingredients. By adding items to this list, users can keep track of what ingredients are readily available in their pantry, fridge, or freezer.

- Recipe Creation and Management

    Users can create and save their own recipes within Menu Master. Each recipe can include a list of necessary ingredients, along with step-by-step instructions.

- Weekly Menu Planning

    Users can plan their weekly menu.  By selecting recipes from their saved collection, users can create a customized menu for each day of the week. 

- Grocery List Generation

    Menu Master will compare the on-hand ingredients with the required ingredients for a selected menu. It will then be able to automatically generate a grocery list for the user based on their menu, minus on-hand ingredients.
